# DotaTeams

This is a simple Angular application that displays data for professional [Dota 2](http://dota2.com/) teams from the [OpenDota API](https://docs.opendota.com/).

# Current Features

Will display the player, match, and hero data for the team with the ID entered in the search bar. Check [OpenDota](https://www.opendota.com/) for team IDs. 

# Planned Features

- Angular Material. This should also result in implementation of pagination, sorting, and filtering for all tables. 
- Different tabs for each of the three tables. 
- Search by name instead of, or in addition to, team ID.
